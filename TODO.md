- GitHub Action
    - Use same base image as `devvm.sh`
        - Add a check for that.
    - Call `make ci`
    - If there's a tag, generate a release with Linux binaries for various archs.
        - Publish Go reference documentation.
        - Publish Go package.
- README.md
    - Add badges
      - GH actions state
      - Go reference
- logging
	- Propagate logging with context
		- Indent log messages by `  ` with each extra item on the stack.
		- This enables output to me a lot more readable.
	- Use https://github.com/uber-go/zap maybe?
- restic apply
    - Improve state (saved / current / desired) comparison: it must also be a function of the resource parameters.
    - Save state in the end.
    - Get final host state, and confirm whether some resource inadvertedly changed something it should not.
    - Paralelise reading state.
- Add TESTS!
- HostState
	- Add field for version, required if the schema changes over time.
- ^C cancel context
- host/ssh.go
    - Implement
- restic plan
	- Implement :-D
	- Add --graphviz option
	- Add --svg option (generate the svg directly from the internal graphviz)
- restic lint
    - Validate resource definitions
    - Lint yaml (format & sort)
- restic refresh
	- Update state from current host state
- restic destroy
    - Destroy all resources at state
- ResourceDefinition
	- refreshed_by: enables a resource (eg: nginx service) to subscribe to any resources it depends on (eg: File[/etc/nginx/.+])
- Go templates
    - Process all resource bundle yamls with Go template
    - Template can be a function of:
        - --host-parameters parms.yaml, containing host specific stuff (Eg: same resource bundle yaml can be used with different hosts)
        - HostInventory
            - General information about the host.
            - Must only contains things that are NOT affected by any resource (eg: CPU, memory etc.)
            - Should save with HostState and check for changes?
            - After apply, reload HostInventory, and check whether anything changed. If so, it means there's a bug in some resource.
