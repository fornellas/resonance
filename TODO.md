- GitHub Action
    - Use same base image as `devvm.sh`
        - Add a check for that.
    - Call `make ci`
    - If there's a tag, generate a release with Linux binaries for various archs.
        - Publish Go reference documentation.
        - Publish Go package.

- `host/local.go`
    - Use [subreaper to wait on all children](https://github.com/fornellas/rrb/blob/main/runner/runner.go).
- `host/ssh.go`: implement.
- `resource/apt_package.go`: implement.
- `resource/file.go`
    - Set default values for parameters.
    - Support `User` and `Group` (requries `host.Host.Getuid/Getgid`)
- `resource/resource.go`
    - `PersistantState`
        - Change interface to only read / write `[]bytes`, so that serialization code can be shared across all interface implementations.
        - Add field with resonance version at schema.
    - `Plan.Execute`
        - At the end check again, fail if changes detected (bug in implementation).
        - On success, save `ResourceBundles` to `PersistantState`.
        - Parallelise check.
    - `LoadResourceBundles`
        - Receive a single directory and load recursively from it.
        - Go templates
            - Before parsing yaml, Go template each resource bundle yaml.
            - Template is a function of:
                - `--host-parameters parms.yaml`, containing host specific stuff (Eg: secrets)
                - `HostInventory`
                    - General information about the host.
                    - Must only contains things that are NOT affected by any resource (eg: CPU, memory etc.)
                    - Should save with state and check for changes?
                    - After apply, reload `HostInventory`
                        - If there are any changes, it means an implementation bug.
                        - There may be valid corner cases here. In such scenarios:
                            - `--allow-inventory-changes` have apply re-run when inventory changes at the end.
                            - Should put a limit (otherwise, inifinite loops can happen).
    - `ManageableResource`
        - Support defining implicit dependencies (eg: APTSource before APTPackage)
    - `ResourceDefinition`
        - Support refreshed_by, to enable resources to subscribe to others (eg: `SystemdUnit[nginx.service]` is `refreshed_by` `File[/etc/nginx/.+]`)
- `cli/**/cmd.go`
    - ^C cancel context
- Add TESTS!
- `cli/check/cmd.go`: implement: checks host state / resources against host.
- `cli/plan/cmd.go`:
    - implement: checks host state / resources and calculate plan against host.
	- Add `--graphviz` option
	- Add `--svg option` (generate the svg directly from the internal graphviz)
- `cli/lint/cmd.go`: implement:
    - Validate resource definitions
    - Lint yaml (format & sort)
- `cli/refresh/cmd.go`
	- Update state to match declared resources.
- `cli/destroy/cmd.go`
    - Destroy all resources at state
