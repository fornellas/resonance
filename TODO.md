- logging
	- Propagate logging with context
		- Indent log messages by `  ` with each extra item on the stack.
		- This enables output to me a lot more readable.
	- Use https://github.com/uber-go/zap maybe?
- HostState
	- Add field for version, required if the schema changes over time.
- restic apply
	- 
- restic plan
	- Implement :-D
	- Add --graphviz option
	- Add --svg option (generate the svg directly from the internal graphviz)
- restic state update
	- Update state from current host state
- ResourceDefinition
	- refreshed_by: enables a resource (eg: nginx service) to subscribe to any resources it depends on (eg: File[/etc/nginx/.+])
- Go templates
    - Process all resource bundle yamls with Go template
    - Template can be a function of:
        - --host-parameters parms.yaml, containing host specific stuff (Eg: same resource bundle yaml can be used with different hosts)
        - HostInventory
            - General information about the host.
            - Must only contains things that are NOT affected by any resource (eg: CPU, memory etc.)
            - Should save with HostState and check for changes?
            - After apply, reload HostInventory, and check whether anything changed. If so, it means there's a bug in some resource.
- ^C cancel context
- host/ssh.go
    - Implement
